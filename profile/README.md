The USACE Github org is unofficially associated with the USACE enterprise and is managed by a group of volunteers.

**General Disclaimer** This organization was created for use by USACE programs to collaborate on projects in support of the USACE mission. GitHub is not hosted by USACE, but is a third party website used by USACE and its partners to share information and collaborate on software. USACE use of GitHub does not imply an endorsement of any one particular service, product, or enterprise.

**New Members** Reach out to Will Breitkreutz, Lyle Seethaler or Randy Goss (find e-mails in outlook, not going to put them here) via USACE e-mail to request access or new repositories.

**Organization Policies** We don't have many rules, but we do have a few, those are documented in our [policies repo](https://github.com/USACE/policies) and may change over time as the organization matures.
